# Test Coverage Metric

The code coverage tool that I use on this project is called "EclEmma". It is a Java code coverage tool for Eclipse. The tool analyzes the project to see how much of the code is covered by tests. The JUnit tests are analyzed to see if theu cover the code. The tools identifies where code is and is not covered which is extremley useful for developers when trying to efficiently test their code. In the image below, you can see that my code is covered by 89.6% by tests. The code that is covered is highlighted in green and code that is not in red
